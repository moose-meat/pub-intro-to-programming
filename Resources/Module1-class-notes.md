# Class Notes For June 30, Module 1

Thank you for taking class!
I wanted to provide this reference for you to summarize some of the things we talked about, and some recommended resources. These resources are not required to finish the course, but it would be great to have some of them for a better over all experience.

> If you have a laptop you can use VSCode as your text editor(IDE)
> [VSCode download](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

> If you do not have a laptop, or are using a mobile device such as an iPad or mobile phone, you can use; [replit>](https://replit.com/)

replit is an online IDE that enables you to write code, without having a computer or laptop. It is 100% free.

**If you have a laptop, and feel comfortable using VSCODE, replit is not required, so you don't need both, you can choose one or the other.**

Since replit requires an account creation, and some members may not have the ability to sign up, or have difficulty with the sign up process, you can use in that case,
[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/), the advantages of CodeSandbox is that you can preview code live also in various screen or display sizes, which will come in handy, later in the course. And again this is not required, just an option.

I want you to feel comfortable in this course, and you have the freedom to use any of the provided options.

Since I will be using GitHub to share some of the code samples, and as a general rule when you begin your coding journey, it's a great idea to sign up and create a GitHub account.

GitHub is an online free repository, where you can save your code to share publicly to showcase your work and progress, or privately as an online backup, in the event something happens to your work machine. Again this is not a requirement, but it's a great resource full of awesome features that we will utilize later in the course.

Visit [GitHub](https://github.com/) to sign up!

## Q&A

---

**1. Where do we get the course content, slides?**

> I will be using the following [repository](https://github.com/ryancollins-dev/pub-intro-to-programming)

**2. Can you provide the VSCode download link?**

> [Download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

**3. Will VSCode work for this course?**

> Yes 100%

**4. Should we make a replit account and then learn where to go after?**

> You have the option, you can use replit, or use VSCode, no need for both. :)

**5. What should we download to the desktop?**

> You can download the content from each module, from GitHub before each class, but that's not required

**6. Can I have your extension list?**

> [Extension List](https://github.com/ryancollins-dev/pub-intro-to-programming/blob/main/Resources/extensions.md)

**7. I feel overwhelmed xD**

> Don't worry, we will cover everything together in detail, and I will be here with you every step of the way. If you get stuck, or need some extra help, please feel free to ask me, I'm here for you 100%

**8. Can we download needed apps and then create a username and then navigate together for each web page?**

> 100%, if you need some extra help, getting any of the applications, or source code, or slides for this course, reach out to me on slack, and I will help you before, or after the next class.

**9. I tried to sign in with Google (to replit) and now im getting a 404 message?**

> The first thing to check is if your are already signed in, if you are not signed in already, try to clear your browser cache, and revisit the page, if all else fails, try Google Chrome as the browser. Also make sure cookies are enabled. If you still have trouble signing in, or signing up, reach out to me on slack, and we can work though it together, outside of class.

**10. My email is x, can you email some of the resources if I cannot get them elsewhere?**

> Yes, no problem, send me an email, I'll be happy to share any of the course resources with you via email.

**11.** Can we get list of terminology used in the course, and useful websites and what each website is for?

> 100%, I will do my best to follow up each class with notes, that include links, explanations of terminology used etc. If I miss anything, please reach out to me on slack.

**12. What browser do you use for development?**

> I personally use Google Chrome, but you can use any browser that you're comfortable with.

**13. What is the link for the resources?**

> All the course resources will be available at [GitHub](https://github.com/ryancollins-dev/pub-intro-to-programming), as well as in Slack, and Google drive.

**14 Is there any recursion in this course?**

> Yes, there may be some examples later on, once we get in to JavaScript, but no promises :)

**15. Is the course layout more reading than listening/video or vice versa?**

> We will try to use a combination of verbal, written, visual resources to help guide all learning styles.

**16. Is anything actually compiled in this course?**

> Short answer, no. This course will focus on the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, where JavaScript is an interpreted language, so we don't have to compile it before running it in the browser. :)

**17. Where can I find the syllabus and any posted notes or terminology?**

> All the course resources will be available at [GitHub](https://github.com/ryancollins-dev/pub-intro-to-programming), as well as in Slack, and Google drive.

**18. Do you have to pay for anything on VSCode?**

> No, VSCode is 100% free!

**19. Where do you find text editor on VSCode?**

> VSCode is a text editor in itself, so you would use it in a similar way to notepad.exe, it just has more functionality.
